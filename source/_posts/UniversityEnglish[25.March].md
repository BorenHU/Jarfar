| 1    | A penny Saved Is a Penny Earned |
| ---- | ------------------------------- |
|      |                                 |

​		As  the  saying  goes,"money  is not almighty(全能的),but without it you can do nothing."

​		Therefore,we can see the importance of money in our life.Some people treasure（珍爱） it very much and believe "A penny saved Is a penny earned"（省一分钱相当于赚一分钱）,so they save it.However,others think money is important just because they can exchange their money for what thry want,and gain immediate pleasures.In my opinion,saving money is necessary for a family.

​		First of all,saving money can help us deal with unexpected things in the future,thus giving us more security. what's more,sometimes saving monry can bring us happiness.It allows us to build up a larger sum,so we can then buy something more worthwhile.Even we can use our savings to help those in need. 		As for me,I'd like to lead a more secure and happier life,so I have the habit of saving monry every single month for unexpected needs.In this way,I will also be able to buy things I truly want but cannot afford right now.

| 2    | Being  Successful Through Self-study |
| ---- | ------------------------------------ |
|      |                                      |

​		Going to a top university has long been the dream of many students and their parents.

​		However,in my opinion,going to college may not be the only way to success.All roads lead to Rome.

​		As Bill Gates once said,self-sudy is the best university.Many eminent（杰出的） figures achieve success through self-study.Gates himself serves as a good example,who dropped out（走出） from the university and,by self-study,accomplishied his goal of setting up a software empire（软件帝国）.

​     	For me,self-study has several advantages.Firstly,self-study is flexible,which enables me to arrange my time and adjust my process according to my work and life.Secondly,as a process of learning without others' guidance,self-study helps me to cultivate（培养） my ability of self-management and independent thinking.Finally,self-study is a method to keep learning.School life will come to an end anyway,and only self-study can keep us learning all the time and enable us to do as the saying goes,"it is never too old to learn".

> 上顶尖大学一直是许多学生和他们父母的梦想。
>
> 然而，在我看来，上大学可能不是唯一的成功之路。条条大路通罗马。
>
> 正如比尔盖茨曾经说过，自修是最好的大学。许多著名的(杰出的)数据通过自学取得成功。盖茨本人作为一个很好的例子,他辍学(走出)大学,通过自学,完成了他的目标建立一个软件帝国(软件帝国)。
>
> 对我来说，自学有几个好处。首先，自学的灵活性使我能够根据工作和生活来安排时间和调整过程。其次,是一个学习的过程没有别人的指导,自学可以帮助我培养(培养)我的自我管理和独立思考能力。最后，自学是一种持续学习的方法。无论如何，学校生活总会结束，只有自学才能让我们一直学习，让我们做，正如俗话所说，“活到老，学到老”。

| 3    | Youth |
| ---- | ----- |
|      |       |

​		As the saying goes,"A year's plan depends on spring,and a day's plan is in the morning."

​		Youth is the morning of life,the dawn of the day,full of purity（纯粹）,illusion（幻想） and harmony（和睦）.

​		Shakespeare once stressed（强调） that those who discard（抛弃） time would be abandoned by it.There is no doubt that youth is the best and the most precious（珍贵的） period（时期） of life for everyone.

​    	However,Why should we strive to（努力） learn knowledge are at their best.During this period of time,there is no pressure for the burden（负担） of life;while you can indulge（沉溺于） in pursuing（追求） things you love.Therefore,we should seize（抓住） this golden time to enrich and improve ourselves.

​    	Flowers are reopened（重新开始）,no one juvenile（青少年的）,Cherish this short but beautiful time!Don't be afraid of making mistakes,because the mistakes,because the mistakes you make in your youth are far more meaningful（有意义的） than the success you get after adulthood（成年）. 

> 俗话说:“一年之计在于春，一日之计在于晨。”
>
> 青春是生命的清晨,黎明的一天,充满纯洁(纯粹),幻觉(幻想)与和谐(和睦)。
>
> 莎士比亚曾经强调(强调),那些丢弃(抛弃)时间就抛弃了它。毫无疑问,青年是最好的和最珍贵(珍贵的)时间(时期)的生活每个人。
>
> 但是,为什么我们要努力(努力)在他们最好的学习知识。在这段时间里,没有负担的压力(负担)的生活,虽然你可以放纵(沉溺于)在追求(追求)你爱的事情。因此,我们应该抓住(抓住)这黄金时间来充实和提高自己。
>
> 花开放(重新开始),没有一个少年(青少年的),珍惜这短暂而美丽的时间!不要害怕犯错误,因为错误,因为错误在你年轻的时候你做更有意义的(有意义的)比成功得到成年后(成年)。

​		Words are the basis of  learning a new language. To learn English well,one should make efforts to memorize english words.Some people think that reciting words in the vocabulary is the best way to learn english well , while others argue that doing lots of reading is the beat way. in my opinion , memorizing English words by using all your senses is an effective way.

​		When meeting new words , try to see ,hear ,smell , taste or even conceive of images to make things referred to by the words appear in your mind. Also , you can divide your task into several smaller tasks , and finish one at a time .

​		Lastly , you can do regular revision and self-test. Wirhout revision , you may easily forget the words you have memorized before.

​		Nothing can be achieved without action . To memorize English words well , I will try to see them in my mind ,making them active and vivid . And i will review words i ' ve learned every two weeks . I believe I can learn Englih well by making such great efforts.

| 5    | Will robots take over all jobs from human? |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------ |
|      |                                            |

​		The fast development of automation technology has been profoundly changing our life. it may just be a matter of time when you get out of your self-driving car, open your door by speaking to it, and sit down to enjoy a supper prepared by your robots.	

​		As the robots are doing more work that used to be done by human, we can't help wondering whether they will take over all jobs from human. My answer is negative. why? First of all, getting robots to do all without human intervention is technologically unpractical. Robots could be multifunctional but they are limited by their hardware. Thus, they need a man hand to help direct them toward a specific goal. Secondly, robots without human control may cause social problems. A machine is not a morally responsible agent, so any consequence of its behavior must be borne by the human. Finally, robots are limited in the fields that require complicated communications and innovation abilities. 

​		So, robots will not take over all the jobs you can do, but they will change the demands and traits of your work. We should prepare ourselves by cultivating our creativity and complex communication, and learning how to work with the robots.

> 自动化技术的快速发展深刻地改变了我们的生活。当你走出你的自动驾驶汽车，通过和它说话打开你的门，坐下来享受你的机器人准备的晚餐，这可能只是一个时间问题。
>
> 由于机器人正在做更多的工作，过去是由人类做的，我们不禁想知道他们是否会接管所有的工作从人类。我的回答是否定的。为什么?首先，让机器人在没有人类干预的情况下完成所有工作在技术上是不现实的。机器人可以是多功能的，但它们受到硬件的限制。因此，他们需要一个男人的手来帮助他们朝着一个特定的目标前进。其次，没有人类控制的机器人可能会造成社会问题。机器并不是道德上负责任的行为主体，因此其行为的任何后果都必须由人来承担。最后，机器人被限制在需要复杂的交流和创新能力的领域。
>
> 因此，机器人不会接管你能做的所有工作，但它们会改变你工作的要求和特点。我们应该培养自己的创造力和复杂的沟通能力，并学习如何与机器人一起工作。
